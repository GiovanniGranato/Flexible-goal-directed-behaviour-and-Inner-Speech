# Flexible-goal-directed-behaviour-and-Inner-Speech

This project investigates the relation between inner speech (a self-directed form of language) and the flexible goal-directed behaviour. In partricular this repository contains a computational model used to approach this research topic in Granato et al. (2022) and Granato et al. (2020). The model performs a neuropsycholoigcal task probing cognitive flexibility (the Wisconsin Cards Sorting test, WCST).

Note that this projects extends the three-component theory of flexible cognition and the related computational model (Granato and baldassarre, 2021), considering both first-order representations (perceptual system) and second-order representations (working memory).

The repository is organized in this way:

- Main:                                                                                       # Main file to run to execute the WCST

    -- Environment                                                                            # Functions to draw the graphical enviroment
