# Flexible-goal-directed-behaviour-and-Inner-Speech

This project investigates the relation between inner speech (a self-directed form of language) and the flexible goal-directed behaviour. In partricular this repository contains a computational model used to approach this research topic (Granato et al., 2020).

The repository is organized in this way:

- Main:                                                                                       # Main file to run to execute the WCST

    -- Environment                                                                            # Functions to draw the graphical enviroment
    
    -- System_Components                                                                      # Components of the model (e.g. fovea, working-memory, etc...)
    
    -- Analysis_Tools_WCST                                                                    # Graphics functions and tools to score the WCST behavioural indices
    
    -- geometricshapes                                                                        # Graphics files 
    
    -- System_files                                                                           # Files of model's components (e.g. networks weights)
